# Rent My Ride

## Directory Structure

## Pages

These will be named after their corresponding route/path.
example: localhost:3000/profile corresponds to src/pages/Profile.jsx
Pages will contain main logic and import/render components.

## Components

These are jsx that we render.
example: a button, profile form, or nav bar.
They live in the components directory and get imported into pages.

css specific to a component should have the same file name and placed in the same directory.
ex. RentalInfoCard.css relates to RentalInfoCard.jsx

- file names should be camelcased and capitalized for both pages and components
- paths are written lowercase
